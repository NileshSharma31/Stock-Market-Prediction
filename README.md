Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis with LSTM.
## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and sequence modeling using LSTM neural networks.

### 1. Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis of Online News
**File:** `03_text_processing_and_sentiment_analysis_of_online_news.ipynb`  
This notebook performs:
- Text cleaning (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Sentiment analysis on online news data
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words)
- Model training using classical ML classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)

### 2. Modeling with LSTM
**File:** `05_modeling_with_LSTM_.ipynb`  
This notebook focuses on:
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec/Tokenizer + Embedding Layer)
- Sequence padding and preprocessing
- LSTM-based sentiment classification model
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss plots

## ðŸ§  Requirements
Install dependencies before running notebooks:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk tensorflow keras
